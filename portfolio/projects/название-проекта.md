\# Content management and auto deployment for VuePress

Let's check out how we can manage the content from within Forestry and automatically deploy our VuePress site.

\## Manage your content with Forestry

This theme is pre-configured and works out of the box with Forestry. Create an account at \[Forestry\]([https://forestry.io](https://forestry.io "https://forestry.io") "Forestry") and import your repository. You can now edit, manage and preview your content.

That's it, that's all. Enjoy your new site!

\## Deployment

1\. Create a new site in \[Vercel\]([https://vercel.com](https://vercel.com "https://vercel.com")) or \[Netlify\]([https://netlify.com](https://netlify.com "https://netlify.com")) and import your repository.

2\. Set the build command to: \`npm run build\`

3\. Set the publish directory to \`portfolio/.vuepress/dist
